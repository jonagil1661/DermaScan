# DermaScan
This is our project for the UGAHacks X 2025 Hackathon.

DermaScan is an interactive Web Application tool built with the StreamLit Python library that gives advice on various skin conditions based on a questionaire and research from credible sources.

It utilizes the Google Maps API to provide users with a dynamic map that recommends users with places to consult based on dermal concerns.

It also incorporates Deep Learning that allows users to select a picture of a skin lesion and have it identified.
A Convulsional Neural Network model, from TensorFlow, was trained with 10,000 images of different skin lesions to achieve a test accuracy of 80%.
